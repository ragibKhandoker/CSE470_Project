## 🌍 Project Overview

Food waste and food insecurity coexist in our communities. Millions of meals are discarded daily by restaurants, banquet halls, and individual donors while nearby shelters and families face hunger. 

**ShareMeal** provides a transparent, secure, and intuitive digital bridge:
- Donors post edible surplus food before it spoils.
- Verified NGOs discover nearby food via interactive maps and schedule collections.
- Receivers can request meals with complete anonymity and claim them with scoped pickup PIN codes.
- Administrators audit NGO verification documents, investigate abuse reports, and ensure platform safety.

* **Relevant Files:** `client/src/pages/receiver/Dashboard.jsx`, `client/src/pages/receiver/FindFood.jsx`, `client/src/components/receiver/MyRequestsModal.jsx`, `client/src/pages/receiver/History.jsx`, `server/controllers/foodRequestController.js`.

### 5. 🏢 NGO Onboarding, Fleet Discovery & Food Rescue Operations
* **Official NGO Onboarding Portal:** Built legal registration workflow where charitable organizations submit government registration numbers, executive NIDs, and trade licenses.
* **NGO Operations Dashboard:** Developed NGO dashboard displaying real-time surplus alerts, incoming donations, and direct collection triggers.
* **Interactive Leaflet Map View:** Integrated dynamic Leaflet & OpenStreetMap engine plotting active food pickup locations across Dhaka with custom markers, popup details, and 1-click directions.

* **Relevant Files:** `client/src/pages/admin/Dashboard.jsx`, `client/src/pages/admin/PendingNGOs.jsx`, `client/src/pages/admin/Reports.jsx`, `server/controllers/adminController.js`.

### 7. 🔒 Advanced Cryptography, Privacy & Data Protection
* **AES-256-CBC Field-Level Database Encryption:** Implemented cryptographic field-level encryption for National ID (NID) numbers and receiver identities in PostgreSQL using Node.js `crypto` with 32-byte SHA-256 derived keys and random initialization vectors (IVs).
* **Batch Encryption Migration Tool:** Authored migration SQL (`019_encrypt_db_aes256.sql`) and standalone migration script (`server/encrypt_existing_nids.js`) to encrypt all legacy unencrypted NIDs in production.
* **Bilingual Public Trust & Support Center:** Designed and built 4 responsive legal and guidance pages with complete English/Bangla dual language toggle and `ScrollToTop` navigation:

* **Relevant Files:** `server/utils/encryption.js`, `server/models/userModel.js`, `client/src/components/common/ScrollToTop.jsx`.

### 8. ⚙️ Reliability Engineering, Image Fallbacks & CI/CD
* **Resilient 2-Tier Image Fallback Architecture:** Engineered a double-layer fallback mechanism eliminating broken image icons across all cards:
  * Backend Express `/uploads` middleware redirecting missing local files to high-quality CDN food photos via 302 redirects (`server/app.js`).
  * Frontend React `onError` event listeners across all card components (`Dashboard.jsx`, `FindFood.jsx`, `IncomingDonations.jsx`, `MyDonations.jsx`).
* **Automated Cloud Database Keep-Alive (CI/CD):** Created automated GitHub Actions cron workflow (`.github/workflows/supabase-keep-alive.yml`) running every 3 days over SSL via `scripts/keep-alive.js`, permanently preventing Supabase Free Tier from entering the 7-day inactivity pause.
* **Deployment Optimization:** Configured `vercel.json` SPA rewrites and unified Express client serving.

## 🛠️ Getting Started & Local Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher installed)
- **npm** (v9 or higher)
- **PostgreSQL / Supabase** database connection string

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hridoy-islam-111/Sharemeal.git
cd Sharemeal
```

### 3. Install All Dependencies
Run from the workspace root to install root, client, and server dependencies at once:
```bash
npm run install:all
```
*(Alternatively: `npm install` in root, then in both `client/` and `server/`)*

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Copy the `.env.example` in `server/` into `.env`:
```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
```

Open `server/.env` and update the values:
```env
PORT=5001
NODE_ENV=development

# Supabase PostgreSQL Pooler Connection
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.xxx:password@aws-0-ap-northeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

# Supabase Storage Configuration (for food post images)
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here

# Google Gemini API for the receiver help assistant
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
GEMINI_FAST_MODEL=gemini-3.8-flash
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-3.8-flash
GEMINI_FALLBACK_MODEL=gemini-3.8-flash
GEMINI_FALLBACK_MODELS=gemini-3.8-flash
```

The role-aware ShareMeal help assistant is available to receivers, donors, NGOs, and admins through Gemini on their authenticated portal. Add a valid Google AI Studio API key to `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `server/.env` and restart the server. `GEMINI_FAST_MODEL` defaults to Gemini 3.8 Flash; unsupported older model names are skipped automatically. `GEMINI_MODEL` and the comma-separated `GEMINI_FALLBACK_MODELS` provide additional fallbacks; `GEMINI_FALLBACK_MODEL` remains supported. Temporary overload/rate-limit/model errors move directly to the next model. Each provider attempt is limited to 15 seconds and the overall request to 35 seconds. Chat questions are sent to Google Gemini; users are warned not to enter personal or sensitive data, and common email/phone/long-number patterns are redacted before forwarding. The assistant can answer general knowledge and ShareMeal project questions, but AI responses can be inaccurate and it cannot access live account data.

Apply migration `024_align_post_status_and_pickup_point_schema.sql` if an existing database reports missing `at_ngo_point` status or `pickup_points.ngo_id`, then restart the backend.

### 5. Run Development Servers
Start both the Express backend API and client watcher concurrently from the root directory:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be live at:
- **Application URL:** [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001)
- **API Endpoint:** [http://localhost:5001/api](http://localhost:5001/api)

---

## 🔒 Security & Trust Architecture

- **Stateless Authentication:** Secure JWT tokens passed via Authorization headers with strict role checks (`donor`, `ngo`, `receiver`, `admin`).
- **Cryptographic Password Hashing:** Salted `bcryptjs` hashing prevents credential leak in case of database inspection.
- **Identity Masking & Data Encryption:** Sensitive receiver identifiers and NIDs are encrypted with AES-256 before persistence.
- **Bot Mitigation:** Visual interactive CAPTCHA checks and IP-based rate limiting guard against automated registration floods.
- **Handover Verification:** Single-use pickup PINs generated per request guarantee food reaches the rightful recipient.

---

## 🚀 Deployment Configuration

### 🌐 Live Production Deployment (Render)
ShareMeal is deployed and running live on Render as a unified full-stack web service:
- **Live Application URL:** [https://sharemeal-gae6.onrender.com/](https://sharemeal-gae6.onrender.com/)
- **Unified Architecture:** The Node.js Express server hosts both the REST API endpoints (`/api/*`) and serves the compiled, optimized React SPA client (`client/dist`) from a single cloud instance.
- **Continuous Deployment:** Any updates merged into the `main` branch are automatically built and deployed.

### ⚡ Client Alternative (Vercel Integration)
The repository also includes a configured `vercel.json` at the root for standalone frontend deployments:
- **Build Command:** `npm run build --workspace=client`
- **Output Directory:** `client/dist`
- **SPA Routing:** Configured rewrite rules ensure client-side routes (e.g. `/donor/dashboard`, `/login`) resolve properly without 404s.
